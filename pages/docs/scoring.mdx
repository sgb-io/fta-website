## Scoring

For conveinience, FTA generates a single `FTA Score` that serves as a general, overall indication of the quality of a particular TypeScript file.

That said, all metrics are exposed and it is up to users to decide how it's metrics can enhance productivity for your team.

Under the hood, a few key metrics are calculated:

- **The Halstead Metrics**: uses the unique and total number of operators and operands in the code to calculate several complexity measures such as size, vocabulary, difficulty, time to program and "delivered bugs".
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: the effective number of distinct logical paths through the code
- **Lines of code**: self explanatory

The full metrics available for each file:
