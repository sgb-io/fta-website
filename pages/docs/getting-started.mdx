## Getting Started

FTA is distributed in several ways:

- The `fta-cli` [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fta-cli) for command-line or server-side Node.js usage _**(Recommended)**_
- The `fta-wasm` [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fta-wasm) - for in-browser WebAssembly usage (this is what the [Playground](/playground) runs)
- The `fta` [Rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/fta) - internal or advanced usage only

The most common and easiest way to use FTA is by calling `fta-cli` either as a binary or from a Node.js server-side context.

You can call it:

- As a script that prints out information about your project (_Recommended_)
  - You can optionally set `score_cap` to require a minimum quality level in your CI (See [Configuration](/docs/configuration))
- From code so that you can programmatically interact with the full output

## Installation

There are several ways to use `fta`. The simplest is to use `fta-cli`:

```
npx fta-cli path/to/project
```

Example output against the Redux project:

For conveinience, FTA generates a single `FTA Score` that serves as a general, overall indication of the quality of a particular TypeScript file.

That said, all metrics are exposed and it is up to users to decide how it's metrics can enhance productivity for your team.

The full metrics available for each file:

```json
{
  "file_name": "combineReducers.ts",
  "cyclo": 28,
  "halstead": {
    "uniq_operators": 28,
    "uniq_operands": 67,
    "total_operators": 271,
    "total_operands": 239,
    "program_length": 95,
    "vocabulary_size": 510,
    "volume": 854.4635765015915,
    "difficulty": 37.84518828451883,
    "effort": 32337.33493496609,
    "time": 1796.5186074981161,
    "bugs": 0.2848211921671972

  "line_count": 202,
  "fta_score": 61.61052634575169,
  "assessment": "(Needs improvement)"
}

## Call FTA from a script

1. To call FTA from a script, install `fta-cli` as a dependency and call it:

To install `fta-cli`:

<Tabs items={["yarn", "npm", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tab>
    <div>`yarn add fta-cli`</div>
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    <div>`npm install fta-cli`</div>
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    <div>`pnpm install fta-cli`</div>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

2. Call `fta` from a `package.json` script:

```json
"scripts": {
  "fta": "fta src"
}
```

## Call FTA from code

You can also call `fta-cli` from code:

```javascript
import { runFta } from "fta-cli";
// CommonJS alternative:
// const { runFta } = require("fta-cli");

// Print the standard ascii table output
const standardOutput = runFta("path/to/project");

// Alternatively, get the full output as JSON so that you can interact with it
const output = runFta("path/to/project", { json: true });
```

It is also possible to make fta print the output as json in a scripting context:

```
yarn fta path/to/project --json
```

To use fta natively in a browser (client-side), the `fta-wasm` package exists. The FTA binary is precompiled to WebAssembley and exposed through this npm package. The `fta-wasm` package can be seen in action on the [Playground](/playground).
