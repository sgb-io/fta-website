# Configuration

FTA expects to be provided a directory ("project root") and will automatically look for TypeScript and JavaScript code within that directory.

To configure how FTA interprets a project, you can either pass CLI arguments or create a `fta.json` file. FTA will automatically look for `fta.json` in the project root, but you can specify this with `--config-path`.

## Supplying Options

Some options can also be controlled via CLI arguments, but not all:

CLI arguments

| Argument        | Description                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `--config-path` | Path to `fta.json`                              |
| `--format`      | Format of the output (`table`, `csv` or `json`) |
| `--json`        | Shorthand for `--format json`                   |

Configuration Options, set via `fta.json`

| Option                | CLI argument         |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| `output_limit`        | `--output-limit`     |
| `score_cap`           | `--score-cap`        |
| `include_comments`    | `--include-comments` |
| `exclude_under`       | `--exclude-under`    |
| `exclude_under`       | `--exclude-under`    |
| `extensions`          | N/A                  |
| `exclude_filenames`   | N/A                  |
| `exclude_directories` | N/A                  |

## Configuration Options

### `output_limit`

How many files to include in the output. Only applies to the `table` format.

- CLI argument: `--output-limit`
- **Default: 5000**

### `score_cap`

Maximum FTA score which will cause FTA to throw. Useful if you want to prevent any files being added to the project that exceed a certain maintainability level. For an existing project, you might opt to set this as your _curent-highest-fta-score_.

- CLI argument: `--score-cap`
- **Default: 1000**

### `include_comments`

Whether to include code comments as part of the analysis. Most of the time, comments should not be considered a contributor towards complexity, hence the default of `false`.

- CLI argument: `--include-comments`
- **Default: false**

### `exclude_under`

Minimum number of lines of code for files to be included in the output. The default is `6` to exclude very small files as a sensible default.

- CLI argument: `--exclude-under`
- **Default: 6**

### `exclude_directories`

An array of directory paths representing directories to exclude from the analysis. Files within any of these directories will be ignored. Paths can be specified as relative to the project root. The defaults are always used; any supplied values are added to the exclusions list.

- **Default: `["/dist", "/bin", "/build"]`**

### `exclude_filenames`

An array of glob patterns representing filenames to exclude from the analysis. Files matching any of these patterns will be ignored. Globs can include wildcards and brace expansions. The defaults are always used; any supplied values are added to the exclusions list. Exclusions will override `extensions`.

- **Default: `[".d.ts", ".min.js", ".bundle.js"]`**

### `extensions`

File extensions to identify files that should be analyzed. JavaScript files are also accepted. The defaults are always used; any supplied values are added to the inclusions list.

- **Default: `[".js", ".jsx", ".ts", ".tsx"]`**

## Example

Example configuration `fta.json`:

```json
{
  "output_limit": 250,
  "score_cap": 90,
  "exclude_directories": ["__fixtures__"],
  "exclude_filenames": ["*.test.{ts,tsx}"],
  "extensions": [".cjs"],
  "include_comments": false,
  "exclude_under": 10
}
```

Here, we've limited the output to 250 files, capped the FTA score to 90, excluded anything in the `/path/to/project/__fixtures__` dir, excluded test files and included files with the `.cjs` extension.

Note: spec/test files (that contain TypeScript or JavaScript code) are included by default, since they constitute material code that must be maintained. This is optional - users are free to exclude test code from outputs, like in this example.
