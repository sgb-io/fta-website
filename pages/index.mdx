  Fast TypeScript Analyzer
</h2>

FTA (Fast TypeScript Analyzer) is a super-fast TypeScript static analysis tool written in Rust. It captures static information about TypeScript code and generates easy-to-understand analytics that tell you about complexity and maintainability issues that you may want to address.

FTA uses [swc](https://github.com/swc-project/swc) to parse your code then runs various analytical routines against it to understand how complex and maintainable it is likely to be. JavaScript code is also supported.

## Quickstart

There are several ways to use `fta`. The simplest is to use `fta-cli`:

```
npx fta-cli path/to/project
```

Example output against the Redux project:

For convenience, FTA generates a single `FTA Score` that serves as a general, overall indication of the quality of a particular TypeScript file.

That said, all metrics are exposed and it is up to users to decide how it's metrics can enhance productivity for your team.

The full metrics available for each file:

```json
{
  "file_name": "combineReducers.ts",
  "cyclo": 28,
  "halstead": {
    "uniq_operators": 28,
    "uniq_operands": 67,
    "total_operators": 271,
    "total_operands": 239,
    "program_length": 95,
    "vocabulary_size": 510,
    "volume": 854.4635765015915,
    "difficulty": 37.84518828451883,

  "line_count": 202,
  "fta_score": 61.61052634575169,
  "assessment": "(Needs improvement)"
}
